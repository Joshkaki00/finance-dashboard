## Responsible AI Usage

In the development of this project, AI was used responsibly in the following ways:

- Generating the initial structure of Redux slices and components
- Implementing the API integration with `createAsyncThunk`
- Designing UI components for different states (loading, error, empty)
- Debugging form validation issues
- Creating responsive Tailwind CSS layouts

The AI-generated code was reviewed, understood, and modified to fit project requirements. I have a complete understanding of all the code in this project and made necessary adjustments to ensure it works as expected.
